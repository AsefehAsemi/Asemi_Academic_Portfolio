# 📊 Scientometrics Analysis

This project explores scientometric patterns in scholarly communication using real datasets from sources such as Web of Science, Scopus, Mendeley, and Google Scholar.

## 📁 File Structure

- `scientometrics_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all data loading, preprocessing, visualization, and analysis steps.
- `data/`: Directory for raw or processed data (if available).
- `outputs/`: Charts, visual summaries, and exportable reports.
- `references.bib`: Bibliographic sources (if applicable).

## 🔬 Project Goals

- Analyze citation trends and altmetrics impact for scientific journals.
- Examine the correlation between article visibility (e.g., Mendeley readership) and traditional impact (e.g., citations).
- Apply clustering and text mining to research topic evolution.
- Compare academic performance across institutions or regions.

## 🔧 Tools & Methods

- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Altmetric API, Scopus API, Google Scholar scraping
- Bibliometric indicators (h-index, g-index, citation per paper)
- Clustering and topic modeling
